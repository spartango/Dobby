Dobby is a collaborative text editor with syntax highlighting. 

It's built on the adOPTed algorithm, laid out in [Ressel et al. 1996](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=240305) and [Ressel et al. 1999](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=320297.320312).

Dobby was built by a handful of freshman at Harvard University in 2011.
